# -Linear-Regression

Linear Regression is a fundamental technique in statistical modeling and machine learning used to establish the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It is widely applied in predictive modeling, data analysis, and forecasting because of its simplicity and interpretability. There are two main types of linear regression: Simple Linear Regression, which involves one independent variable, and Multiple Linear Regression, which includes two or more independent variables.

The primary objective of implementing linear regression is to build a model that can predict the output variable (target) based on input variables (features). In simple terms, the model fits a line (in simple regression) or a hyperplane (in multiple regression) through the data points in such a way that the sum of the squared differences between the actual values and the predicted values (errors) is minimized.

To begin with, the first step in any linear regression task is importing and preprocessing the dataset. Using Python libraries like Pandas, we can load datasets from various sources such as CSV files or online repositories. Preprocessing involves handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, normalizing or scaling features (if needed), and ensuring the data is clean and suitable for training the model.

Next, the dataset is split into training and testing sets. This step is crucial to assess the performance of the model on unseen data. Typically, 70% to 80% of the data is used for training, and the remaining 20% to 30% is reserved for testing. This is commonly done using train_test_split from sklearn.model_selection.

Once the data is prepared, we fit the Linear Regression model using sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression. The model learns the coefficients (weights) of the input features during training by minimizing the cost function, which is often the mean squared error (MSE). These coefficients represent the change in the target variable for a one-unit change in the respective feature, keeping all other features constant.
